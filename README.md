## AIOTI Smart Cities and Communities Portfolio

The focus of this catalogue is mainly on Smart Cities and Communities, but of course, rural areas will be included. Smart Cities are cross-cutting by integrating and touching all domains; not only the horizontal but also the vertical domains are intertwined with Smart Cities.

Aligned with the European Commission's vision, the main objective is to implement a human-centric approach in which societal challenges are the drivers pushing forward smart solutions, an approach different from the conversant technical-centric vision. The main objective is to increase the drivers of success, gain a more solid footing, overcome big blockades, and last but not least, do the right thing for our ecosystem of people, society, ecology, and economy. 

We will do this by linking to related digital areas like public services, digital privacy, cybersecurity, and healthy living, focusing on the European Commission's main policies.

We have the power to make a difference with the AIOTI community. Let’s not forget how much difference we can make, not only for Europe but also across borders. We are on a mission: Let’s (re-)build more resilient, greener, digital, and healthier Smart Cities and Communities. We invite you to join us in this work.
